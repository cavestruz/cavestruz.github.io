Welcome!
======
I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan in the [Physics Department](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics) and [Leinweber Center for Theoretical Physics](https://lsa.umich.edu/lctp).  My research group focuses on various topics in Computational Cosmology and Astrophysics.  We work with data from a variety of cosmological simulations to help interpret observed data from surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's [Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/) and the [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/).  In LSST, we are fairly involved with the [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/).  We also build software to enable models of the galaxy-halo connection and to perform inference on survey images.
