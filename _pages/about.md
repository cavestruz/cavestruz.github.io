Welcome!
======
I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan in the [Physics Department](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics) and [Leinweber Center for Theoretical Physics](https://lsa.umich.edu/lctp).  My research group focuses on various topics in Computational Cosmology and Astrophysics.  We work with data from a variety of cosmological simulations to help interpret observed data from surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's [Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)](https://www.lsst.org/) and the [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/).  In LSST, we are fairly involved with the [Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC)](https://lsstdesc.org/).  We also build software to enable models of the galaxy-halo connection and to perform inference on survey images.  Check out the group twitter (now X) to see [recent news](https://twitter.com/alcca_um). 

Interested in Joining?
======
If you are an undergraduate student at UMich interested in research, our group typically takes a student through the Physics Department's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship for Physics majors.  If you are interested in joining the group through this program and wish to list me as a potential research adviser in the application, please also email me with a summary of your previous research experience, your expected semester of graduation, and any coding/software development experience you might have had.  

If you are an undergraduate student from a different institution interested in research, please consider applying to our [REU program](https://reu.physics.lsa.umich.edu/).  Our group also typically takes a student through the REU program.

If you are a current UMich PhD student and a current or prospective postdoc interested in working on a research project, please reach out to me directly over email.  

If you are interested in the Physics PhD program at UMich, please see information [here](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics/graduate-students.html).  I am typically unable to respond to the numerous individual inquiries pre-admisison.  If you admitted to a UMich graduate program, I would be happy to chat over possible research projects and collaborations as you consider your options.  ALCCA has ongoing collaborations with faculty in the Astronomy and Statistics departments of UMich.
