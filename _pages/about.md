Welcome!
======
I am an Assistant Professor at the University of Michigan in the [Physics Department](https://lsa.umich.edu/physics) and [Leinweber Center for Theoretical Physics](https://lsa.umich.edu/lctp).  My research group focuses on various topics in Computational Cosmology and Astrophysics.  We work with data from a variety of cosmological simulations to help interpret observed data from surveys such as the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey.  We also build software to enable models of the galaxy-halo connection and to perform inference on survey images.
