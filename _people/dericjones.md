## About me
I'm a 1st year PhD student at the University of Michigan Department of Physics. My main interests lie in large-scale structure and galaxy clusters in cosmology, and how these can be used to probe cosmological models. Outside of physics, I enjoy hiking, biking, cooking, and board games. 

## Research
I study galaxy clusters and their triaxial signatures, searching for their observables in cosmological simulations for LSST DESC and how they can be used to trace large-scale structure. Additionally, I'm helping work on a modified gravity emulator around Horndeski gravity, focusing on setting up the parameter space.

To do: 
* get some images for research
* Other research stuff
