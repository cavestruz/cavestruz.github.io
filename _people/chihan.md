## About me
I'm studying for B.S. degrees in Physics, Astronomy & Astrophysics, and Mathematics, with expected graduation in May 2024. In my spare time, I enjoy long-distance running, camping, playing soccer and playing Japanese mahjong.  Please visit my personal website [here](https://suzutsuki-ch.github.io/).

## Research interests
My research covers topics in stellar astrophysics and cosmology, instructed by Prof. John Monnier, Prof. Camille Avestruz, Dr. Tyler Gardner, and Dr. Kuan Wang.
